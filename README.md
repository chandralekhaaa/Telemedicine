# Telemedicine

Note: This project is still in progress. Only the frontend is complete, the backend is yet to be pushed.

Project Description
<br/>In this project, I have designed and implemented a telemedicine application. The Telemedicine application intends to provide various services such as medical diagnosis, treatment, counseling and education through the use of technology.
The Telemedicine application provides several benefits. Patients need not physically visit the doctor’s office when they are sick. Instead they can virtually visit the doctor from the comfort of their home. It saves a lot of time from everyone’s busy schedule. The Telemedicine system helps to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. It saves sick people from the exposure of other people’s germs. Even patients from rural and underserved urban areas can get expert care through the Telemedicine system.
